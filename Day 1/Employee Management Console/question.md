### ðŸ§  Topics Covered

* Variables
* Data Types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `dict`)
* Control Flow (`if`, `else`, `elif`, `while`)

---

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Create a **console-based Employee Management System** using only Python basics â€” no functions, no external libraries.

---

### âœ… Requirements

Your task is to:

1. **Take input for 5 employees**. For each employee, collect:

   * **Name** (string)
   * **Age** (integer)
   * **Salary** (float)
   * **Department** (string)

2. Store this data in a **list of dictionaries**, where each dictionary represents an employee.

3. After all data is entered, display a **repeating menu**:

   ```
   ==== EMPLOYEE MENU ====
   1. Show all employees
   2. Show average salary
   3. Show employees by department
   4. Show highest-paid employee
   5. Exit
   =======================
   ```

4. Based on the userâ€™s input:

   * **Option 1:** Print details of all employees.
   * **Option 2:** Calculate and display the **average salary**.
   * **Option 3:** Ask for a department name and show employees in that department.
   * **Option 4:** Display the **employee with the highest salary**.
   * **Option 5:** Exit the program.

### ðŸ›‘ Restrictions

* Do **not** use functions (`def`) or any libraries.
